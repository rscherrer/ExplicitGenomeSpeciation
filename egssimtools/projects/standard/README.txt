In this first experiment, we wanted to characterize the behavior of our model across a realm of ecological conditions that are relevant to adaptive speciation, and how the genotype-phenotype map may affect these patterns. We ran simulations spanning a range of habitat symmetry and ecological trade-off values that were thought to encompass the range of conditions that are favorable to the different modes of speciation to occur, given fixed values for the other parameters. We varied the genotype-phenotype mapping of the ecological trait and tested three scenarios: (1) the additive scenario, where all three traits are encoded additively, (2) the intermediate case where the additive and the epistatic components of the genotype-phenotype map had equal contributions, and (3) the epistatic scenario, where the phenotype depends entirely on epistatic interactions. The other traits were encoded additively. 20 replicate simulations were run for each parameter combination, and the simulations were run for 20,000 generations. All other parameters were kept fixed. Every simulation in this experiment had its own randomly generated architecture, so no genetic architecture was recycled in multiple simulations. We recorded the levels of ecological, reproductive and spatial isolation through time at every 100 generations.
