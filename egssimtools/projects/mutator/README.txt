In this second experiment, we repeat the simulation runs of the first experiment, this time with a 10-fold increase in mutation rate. The aim is to test whether the sensitivity of the model outcome on epistasis depends on the degree of genetic variation in the population. We hypothesize that epistatic interactions should produce a behavior that deviates from additivity only if multiple alleles segregate at multiple loci in the population.
