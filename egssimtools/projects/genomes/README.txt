In this folder we ran simulations to investigate the signature that different genotype-phenotype maps leave in the genome during speciation. We choose 5 seeds, so 5 genetic architectures, and we simulate each of them in all combinations of two ecological scenarios (competitive speciation, h = 1, s = 1.6 and ecological speciation, h = 0, s = 1) by two genetic scenarios (all traits encoded additively vs all traits encoded epistatically). We run the simulations for 20,000 generations because it seems that this is the time needed for genetic variables such as Fst to reach some genome-wide equilibrium, under the chosen parameter values. We save nearly all possible variables. Note that there are many possible combinations of additive and epistatic traits, but we chose to focus first on the two extremes (all additive vs all epistatic). A more extensive investigation could be performed on the cluster.
