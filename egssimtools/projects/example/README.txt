In this experiment we ran short simulations and recorded only individual traits and population sizes. The aim was mainly to provide data to plot figures showing the distribution of traits through time. We simulated for 2,000 generations, which is often enough under the chosen parameter values to reach divergence. We ran two scenarios: a competitive speciation scenario (hsymmetry = 1 and ecosel = .6) and an ecological parapatric scenario (hsymmetry = 0 and ecosel = 1), both with additive or epistatic mapping of the ecological trait. We replicated the simulations for three different seeds.
